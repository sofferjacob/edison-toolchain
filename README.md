# Sierra Toolchain
This is the toolchain used to cross-compile Sierra from source. It is compatible with any kind of
architecture (host).

# Using it.
You can build it and use the toolchain in any UNIX like OS (Linux, macOS, BSD). First clone the repository to your computer and run:
```
cd toolchain
./build.sh
```

Wait a while for your toolchain to download and build, then you will have your toolchain installed in /opt/cross.
