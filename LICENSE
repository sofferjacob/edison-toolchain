How to Apply These Terms to Your New Software

  If you develop a new software, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to
release the source for educational purposes only so everyone can 
redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    {one line to give the software's name}
    {one line to give the file name and a brief idea of what it does.}
    Copyright (c) {year}  {name of author} <authors email>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the Sierra Open Source Software License, either 
    version 1.0 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    Sierra Open Source Software License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the Sierra Open Source Software
    License along with this program.  If not, see 
    https://github.com/sofferjacob/Sierra-Kernel/blob/master/LICENSE.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    {project}  Copyright (c) {year}  {fullname}
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
